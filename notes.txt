notes:
- choices field used CharField(choices=CHOICES) instead of extending it as ForeignKey for simplicity
- used build-in domain name validator from django 5.1 instead of creating new one manually
- marked texts as translatable even if translate is not required now it's become much easier later when generating .po files
- skipped data privacy for profiles model
- critical actions like deactivate profiles should be only allowed to privileged users
- /api/export/id/download for simplicity returned the file directly to browser from server
- skipped .env file [ secret keys / database credentials ]




Export:
    used temp file to avoid IOBytes in memory for large amount of order exports
    used queryset iterator and select_related for performance reasons

Retry Logic:
    used signals for observe failed orders stats and check profile instance for failed counter and auto deactivate
    added manually deactivate too as admin action in orders page


API RATE LIMIT:
    added rate limit per user : 1000/day
